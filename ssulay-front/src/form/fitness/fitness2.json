One of my favorite ways to stay active is through participating in group fitness classes. From high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to dance-based workouts, I enjoy the energy and motivation that comes from exercising alongside others. Recently, I've been particularly interested in trying out different forms of martial arts as a means of staying fit and learning self-defense techniques. It's a great way to challenge myself physically while also improving focus and discipline."
