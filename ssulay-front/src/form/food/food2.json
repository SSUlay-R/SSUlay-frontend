Firstly, I love cooking and experimenting with different flavors and cuisines. Recently, I've been trying out new recipes and challenging myself to recreate dishes from different cultures. Secondly, I enjoy exploring local food markets and specialty stores. I find pleasure in discovering unique ingredients and learning about their origins and uses. Lately, I've been exploring Korean grocery stores online to familiarize myself with Korean ingredients and spices. Lastly, I have a passion for dining out and experiencing different restaurants and eateries. Whether it's trying a new trendy cafe, visiting a street food market, or indulging in a fine dining experience, I appreciate the culinary craftsmanship and the atmosphere that accompanies each dining experience.",
