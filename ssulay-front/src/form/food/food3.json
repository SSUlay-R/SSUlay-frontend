Firstly, I am thrilled to immerse myself in Korean cuisine and explore the diverse range of flavors and dishes. I hope to try authentic Korean dishes like bibimbap, bulgogi, or kimchi and experience the various banchan (side dishes) that accompany meals. Secondly, I am eager to venture into local street food markets and taste the vibrant street food culture in Korea. From tteokbokki to hotteok, I want to indulge in the delicious and convenient treats that Korean street vendors offer. Lastly, I am interested in taking part in cooking classes or food tours to learn more about the techniques and secrets behind Korean culinary traditions. I hope to engage with local food enthusiasts, chefs, and home cooks to deepen my understanding of Korean food culture."
