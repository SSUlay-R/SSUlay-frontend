I dream of attending thrilling concerts where my favorite idols will captivate the audience with their mesmerizing performances and infectious energy. Exploring the vibrant streets of Seoul, I anticipate stumbling upon trendy music shops, bustling entertainment agencies, and even the chance to witness the filming of a music video. I yearn to engage with passionate K-pop fans, sharing our love for the music, dancing to catchy tunes, and joining fan events where we can connect with fellow enthusiasts.
