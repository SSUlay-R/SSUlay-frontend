  "form": "In my free time, music takes center stage as one of my greatest passions. There are a few things related to music that I thoroughly enjoy. Firstly, I love playing the guitar and creating my own melodies. Recently, I've been experimenting with different chord progressions and song structures to compose original pieces. Secondly, I enjoy attending live music performances and concerts. Whether it's a small local gig or a big arena show, the energy and connection between the artist and the audience captivate me. Lately, I've been exploring upcoming concerts and music festivals in my area. Lastly, I find pleasure in discovering new music from various genres and artists. I enjoy diving into different music cultures, exploring different eras, and expanding my musical horizons. During my exchange in Korea, I have high expectations and exciting musical experiences I am looking forward to. Firstly, I am eager to explore the vibrant K-pop scene. Attending live K-pop concerts and experiencing the energetic performances would be a dream come true. Secondly, I am interested in immersing myself in traditional Korean music. I hope to attend traditional music performances, learn about Korean traditional instruments like the gayageum or the janggu, and even try my hand at playing them. Lastly, I am open to discovering and learning about different Korean music genres beyond K-pop, such as indie, hip-hop, or trot. I'm excited to explore the local music scene, discover talented Korean artists, and attend music events that showcase diverse genres.",
