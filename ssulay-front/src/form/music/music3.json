The piano and guitar are my instruments of choice, and I love immersing myself in their melodic possibilities. Recently, I've been exploring different genres and styles, experimenting with improvisation and composing my own music. It's a creative outlet that allows me to express myself and connect with my emotions on a deeper level.",
